        About Me
      </h3>
      <p className="py-4 md:text-lg text-sm">
        After spending 9 years as a researcher and earning my PhD in
        geo-sciences, I shifted gears to focus on front-end development, a field
        I've always been passionate about. Leveraging my problem-solving skills
        and knack for self-learning from my research background, I quickly
        picked up skills like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React in
        the realm of front-end development. I'm always eager to learn and thrive
        in collaborative team settings.
