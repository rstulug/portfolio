          Born in Isparta City, Turkey, in 1991, I pursued my passion for
          geomatics engineering, earning a bachelor's degree from Selcuk
          University in 2014. This journey led me to Istanbul Technical
          University, where I obtained a master's degree in 2017, delving deeper
          into the field. Continuing my academic pursuits, I completed my Ph.D.
          in Geodesy and Geographical Information Technologies Department at
          Middle East Technical University in 2024. Throughout my academic
          journey, I conducted rigorous research, published papers, and
          presented findings internationally. Alongside my academic endeavors, I
          cherish my role as a spouse and parent, finding balance and
          fulfillment in both my personal and professional life.

          After spending 9 years as a researcher, I focused on front-end
          development, a field I've always been passionate about. Leveraging my
          problem-solving skills and knack for self-learning from my research
          background, I quickly picked up skills like JavaScript, TypeScript,
          HTML, CSS, and React in front-end development. I'm always eager to
          learn and thrive in collaborative team settings.
